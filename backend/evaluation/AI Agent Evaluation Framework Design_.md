## **Section 1: The HATT-E Framework: A Multi-Layered Evaluation Approach for Hierarchical Agents**

The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of sophisticated AI agents capable of autonomous reasoning and action.1 A particularly promising architectural paradigm is the hierarchical multi-agent system (MAS), where a coordinator agent decomposes complex tasks and delegates sub-tasks to specialized agents, mirroring organizational structures in human teams.3 This structure, as seen in systems like AgentOrchestra 6 and AutoGen 8, allows for modularity, scalability, and the combination of diverse expert capabilities. However, the proliferation of these novel architectures has outpaced the development of evaluation methodologies capable of rigorously assessing their performance.9

This report introduces the **Hierarchical Agent and Tool-use Evaluation (HATT-E)** framework, a novel, multi-layered methodology designed specifically for the comprehensive evaluation of hierarchical, tool-using multi-agent systems. Standard benchmarks, while valuable, often fall short by treating agents as monolithic entities or focusing on isolated, single-step actions. HATT-E deconstructs the evaluation process into three distinct layers that mirror the system's architecture—Orchestration, Specialization, and Collaboration—enabling precise attribution of successes and failures and providing deep, diagnostic insights suitable for high-impact academic research.

### **1.1. Conceptual Foundation: Why a New Framework is Necessary**

Existing evaluation frameworks provide essential tools but possess inherent limitations when applied to hierarchical MAS. A thorough analysis reveals a critical "hierarchical evaluation gap," necessitating a more nuanced approach.

* **Analysis of Existing Benchmarks:**  
  * **Tool-Centric Benchmarks (ToolBench, API-Bank):** Frameworks like ToolBench 10 and API-Bank 2 have been instrumental in standardizing the evaluation of an agent's fundamental ability to use tools. They meticulously assess an agent's capacity to select the correct API from a pool, construct a valid call with accurate parameters, and interpret the result.2 However, their focus is on the atomic skill of tool manipulation, often in single-agent, single-step scenarios.12 They effectively answer  
    *if* a tool can be used correctly, but they do not provide a mechanism to evaluate *how well* a task requiring that tool was delegated, how the results were integrated into a larger plan, or how the responsibility for the tool-use was orchestrated within a team of agents.  
  * **General Agent Capability Benchmarks (AgentBench):** AgentBench represents a significant step forward, assessing an LLM's ability to act as an agent across a diverse set of eight environments, including operating systems, databases, and web browsing.13 It evaluates reasoning and decision-making in multi-turn, open-ended settings.16 While it captures long-term reasoning, its evaluation paradigm is primarily geared towards a single agent's performance. It does not explicitly model or provide metrics for the coordination, communication, and delegation dynamics that are the defining characteristics of a hierarchical multi-agent system.14  
  * **Reliability and Interaction Benchmarks (τ-bench):** The τ-bench framework introduces the critical dimensions of reliability and dynamic interaction with a simulated user and external tools.12 It evaluates an agent's ability to adhere to complex, domain-specific rules and maintain consistency across multiple trials, measuring success by comparing the final database state against an expected goal state.12 This focus on reliability in multi-step interactions is highly relevant. However, τ-bench's evaluation is external, assessing the final state and user-facing responses, rather than the internal mechanics of how a hierarchical system decomposes a problem and coordinates its internal agents to achieve that final state.  
* The Hierarchical Evaluation Gap:  
  The central challenge in evaluating a hierarchical system is that the final output is the result of a complex causal chain of actions spanning multiple agents and layers of abstraction.3 A task failure is rarely a single, isolated event. The root cause could be a flaw in the top-level orchestrator's initial plan, a misunderstanding during the handoff to a specialist, a specialist's incorrect use of its tool, or an error in how the final results are synthesized.4 Existing benchmarks are not designed to deconstruct this causal chain. They might flag a failed tool call but cannot systematically determine if the failure was due to the specialist agent's incompetence or because it received a poorly formulated sub-task from its coordinator. The HATT-E framework is explicitly designed to fill this gap by providing distinct evaluation layers that align with the system's functional hierarchy, enabling a diagnostic analysis that moves beyond simple outcome-based scoring to root cause identification. This layered approach is essential for understanding and improving the complex interplay within multi-agent systems.

### **1.2. Layer 1: Orchestration and Decomposition Analysis (The "Engineer Chat Agent")**

This foundational layer of the HATT-E framework isolates and evaluates the performance of the top-level coordinating agent, referred to as the "orchestrator" or "planner".18 The primary responsibility of this agent is not to execute the final task, but to interpret the user's high-level intent, formulate a coherent plan, break it down into executable sub-tasks, and delegate these sub-tasks to the appropriate specialist agents.18

* **Key Evaluation Questions:**  
  * **Intent Understanding:** How accurately does the orchestrator comprehend the user's request, especially when it is ambiguous or complex? This assesses the agent's initial reasoning and grounding of the problem.20  
  * **Task Decomposition Quality:** This is the core of the orchestrator's function. The evaluation must determine if the agent breaks down the problem into sub-tasks that are logical, coherent, mutually exclusive, and collectively exhaustive.21 The quality of this decomposition directly impacts the feasibility of the entire workflow.  
  * **Delegation Logic (Agent Routing):** After decomposing the task, does the orchestrator correctly assign each sub-task to the specialist agent best equipped to handle it? This requires the orchestrator to have an accurate internal model of its sub-agents' capabilities and tools.23  
  * **Handoff Quality:** A successful delegation requires more than just assigning a task; it involves a handoff of information. This evaluation assesses the effectiveness of context transfer. Is all necessary information (e.g., user constraints, data from a previous step, file paths) packaged and passed to the specialist agent without loss or distortion?.23

### **1.3. Layer 2: Specialist Agent and Tool Proficiency Analysis (The Two Sub-Agents)**

The second layer of HATT-E focuses on the individual performance of each specialist sub-agent. The evaluation at this level is more constrained and atomic. It assumes the sub-task received from the orchestrator (Layer 1\) is well-formed and assesses the specialist's proficiency in executing that specific sub-task using its designated tools. This layer effectively treats each specialist as a single, tool-augmented agent being tested on a narrow, well-defined problem.

* **Key Evaluation Questions:**  
  * **Tool Selection and Parameterization:** Given a clearly defined sub-task, does the specialist agent select the correct tool from its available set? Crucially, are the parameters passed to the tool's API call accurate, correctly formatted, and complete? This is a direct measure of the agent's ability to translate a natural language goal into a machine-executable action.10  
  * **Tool Execution and Error Handling:** Does the tool call execute successfully, or does it return an error from the external API? More importantly, how does the agent react to failures? A robust agent should be able to handle common errors (e.g., API timeouts, invalid credentials, 404 not found) by attempting retries with backoff, reformulating the request, or reporting the unrecoverable failure back to the orchestrator for replanning.27  
  * **Result Interpretation:** Following a successful tool call, the agent receives a raw output (e.g., a JSON object, a log file content). How well does the agent parse this raw data and interpret its meaning in the context of the sub-task? The evaluation must check for hallucinations or misinterpretations that could poison the information being passed back up the hierarchy.

### **1.4. Layer 3: System-Level and Collaborative Performance Analysis**

The third and final layer of HATT-E provides a holistic, end-to-end evaluation of the multi-agent system as a whole. It treats the entire architecture as a single black box to measure its ultimate effectiveness in solving the user's problem. This layer also assesses the emergent properties of the system, such as efficiency and reliability, which arise from the collaboration between agents.

* **Key Evaluation Questions:**  
  * **Overall Task Success:** Did the system, as a cohesive unit, successfully and correctly fulfill the user's original, high-level request? This is the ultimate measure of performance and requires a strict, predefined definition of success for each task.28  
  * **Collaborative Efficiency:** How efficiently did the system achieve its goal? This is a multi-faceted question that involves measuring resource consumption and time. Key metrics include the total computational cost (e.g., tokens used), API call costs, and end-to-end latency from the initial user query to the final response.30 The number of communication turns between agents is also a critical indicator; excessive turns may signal confusion, inefficiency, or flawed coordination.20  
  * **Integration and Synthesis:** How effectively did the orchestrator agent (Layer 1\) integrate the distinct results received from its specialist agents (Layer 2\) to formulate the final, coherent response? A system can have perfect specialists but fail if the orchestrator cannot synthesize their outputs into a unified, logical answer.  
  * **Robustness and Reliability:** How consistently does the system perform when faced with the same or similar tasks over multiple runs? Real-world deployment requires predictable and stable behavior. This evaluation, inspired by frameworks like τ-bench, assesses the system's tendency to produce deterministic or stochastic outputs and its resilience to minor variations in input phrasing.12

A crucial aspect of hierarchical systems is the potential for a "cascade effect," where a small error at a higher level of the hierarchy can be amplified into a significant failure at lower levels. For instance, a slightly ambiguous task decomposition by the orchestrator (a Layer 1 flaw) might cause a specialist agent to select a completely incorrect tool (a Layer 2 failure), leading to an overall system failure (a Layer 3 outcome). Existing benchmarks that focus on isolated components, such as ToolBench's evaluation of a single tool call 10, would simply register this as a failure of the specialist agent. This diagnosis is incomplete because it misses the root cause. Frameworks designed for multi-agent systems, like AutoGen or AgentOrchestra, emphasize the orchestrator's role in planning 6, and failure taxonomies like MAST identify "inter-agent misalignment" as a critical failure category.34 The HATT-E framework connects these concepts. A misalignment is often not just a communication glitch but a symptom of a deeper problem originating in the initial plan. By structuring the evaluation in layers, HATT-E facilitates a diagnostic trace-back. An analyst can correlate failures at Layer 3 with specific weaknesses identified in Layer 2 or Layer 1, thereby pinpointing the origin of the cascade. This transforms the evaluation from a simple performance measurement into a powerful diagnostic tool for debugging and improving the system's architecture.18

The table below provides a high-level summary of the HATT-E framework's structure and objectives, serving as a roadmap for the detailed metrics that follow.

**Table 1: The HATT-E Framework at a Glance**

| Layer | Agent(s) in Focus | Primary Objective | Key Evaluation Questions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Layer 1: Orchestration** | Engineer Chat Agent (Orchestrator) | To effectively plan, decompose, and delegate tasks. | How well does it understand intent? How logical is the task decomposition? Is delegation accurate? Is the handoff of information complete? |
| **Layer 2: Specialization** | Two Specialist Sub-Agents | To proficiently execute a specific, delegated sub-task using assigned tools. | Does it select the correct tool? Are parameters accurate? How does it handle tool errors? Is the tool's output interpreted correctly? |
| **Layer 3: Collaboration** | Entire Multi-Agent System | To successfully solve the end-to-end user request through efficient and reliable collaboration. | Was the final task completed successfully? What was the overall cost and latency? How well were results integrated? How reliable is the system? |

## **Section 2: Quantitative Evaluation Metrics and Methodologies**

This section provides the formal definitions and methodologies for the quantitative metrics that form the empirical foundation of the HATT-E framework. For academic rigor and reproducibility, each metric is precisely defined, and its method of calculation is specified. These metrics are drawn from established benchmarks where appropriate and supplemented with novel measures designed to address the unique challenges of hierarchical agent evaluation.

### **2.1. Layer 1: Orchestration and Decomposition Metrics**

These metrics are designed to quantify the performance of the orchestrator agent in its role as a planner and coordinator.

* **Decomposition Quality Score (DQS):** This is a novel, composite metric designed to assess the quality of the orchestrator's task breakdown. Given the nuanced nature of what constitutes a "good" plan, DQS is evaluated using an LLM-as-a-Judge approach.27 A powerful, independent LLM is provided with the user's request and the orchestrator's proposed sub-tasks and scores the decomposition based on a structured rubric. The final DQS for a given task is the average of the scores across the following criteria, each rated on a Likert scale of 1 to 5:  
  * *Logical Coherence:* Assesses whether the sub-tasks form a logical and sensible breakdown of the main goal.  
  * *Executability:* Determines if each sub-task is sufficiently well-defined and atomic to be actionable by a specialist agent.  
  * *Completeness:* Checks if the set of sub-tasks, when taken together, fully covers the scope of the original user request.  
  * *Efficiency:* Evaluates whether the decomposition is parsimonious or contains redundant or unnecessary sub-tasks.  
* Delegation Accuracy (DA): This is a straightforward classification accuracy metric. It requires a ground truth dataset where each test case has a known optimal delegation plan. The metric measures the orchestrator's ability to route each sub-task to the correct specialist agent. It is calculated as:

  DA=Total Number of Sub-tasksNumber of Correctly Delegated Sub-tasks​  
* **Handoff Information Fidelity (HIF):** This metric quantifies the quality of information transfer during the handoff from the orchestrator to a specialist. A low score indicates critical context loss, a common failure mode in multi-agent systems.34 It is measured by comparing the semantic content of the information required for the sub-task (defined in the ground truth) with the actual context passed by the orchestrator. This comparison can be implemented using a semantic similarity metric like BERTScore 35, which produces a score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect fidelity.

### **2.2. Layer 2: Specialist Agent and Tool Proficiency Metrics**

These metrics are adapted from well-established benchmarks like ToolBench 10 to evaluate the core competencies of the specialist agents in using their assigned tools.

* **Plan Exact Match (Plan.EM):** A binary metric that scores whether the agent's decision to use a tool at a given step matches the ground truth plan. In the context of a specialist agent, this measures if it correctly decides to invoke its tool in response to the delegated sub-task.10  
* **Action Exact Match (Act.EM):** This is a strict and critical metric for tool-use correctness. It yields a score of 1 if and only if the name of the tool called *and* all of its parameters exactly match the ground truth; otherwise, the score is 0\.10 This ensures that the agent is not only choosing the right tool but using it in the right way.  
* **Tool Success Rate (TSR):** This pragmatic metric measures the percentage of tool calls that execute without raising an API error and return a valid, non-null response. It reflects the agent's ability to successfully interact with its external environment, distinct from whether the call was logically correct.32  
* **Hallucination Rate (HalluRate):** This measures the frequency with which the agent generates factually incorrect statements when interpreting or summarizing the output from a tool call. A lower rate is better. This can be evaluated using an LLM-as-a-Judge that compares the agent's summary of the tool output against the raw tool output for factual consistency.10

### **2.3. Layer 3: System-Level and Collaborative Performance Metrics**

These metrics provide a holistic, end-to-end assessment of the entire multi-agent system.

* **Overall Task Success Rate (SR):** The primary metric of overall performance. It is a binary score (1 for success, 0 for failure) indicating whether the system as a whole correctly and completely fulfilled the user's initial request. The criteria for success must be strictly and unambiguously defined for each task in the evaluation dataset.16  
* **Response Quality Metrics:**  
  * **N-gram-based Metrics (ROUGE-L, BLEU):** For tasks that involve generating a textual response, ROUGE-L (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) and BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) can be used to compare the generated text against a "golden" reference answer by measuring n-gram overlap.10 These are most suitable for tasks like summarization where specific keywords are expected.  
  * **Semantic Similarity Metrics (BERTScore):** For tasks where the exact wording can vary but the semantic meaning must be preserved, BERTScore provides a more robust measure of response quality by comparing the contextual embeddings of the generated and reference answers.35  
* **Efficiency Metrics (Adapted from the CLASSic Framework):** Inspired by the CLASSic framework's multi-dimensional approach 30, these metrics quantify the resource consumption of the system.  
  * **Cost:** A critical metric for real-world deployment. It is measured as the total number of LLM tokens (prompt \+ completion) consumed by all agents throughout the workflow, and can also include the number of billable API calls made.28  
  * **Latency:** The end-to-end wall-clock time from the moment the user submits a query to the moment the final response is delivered. This is a key driver of user experience.30  
  * **Turn Count:** The total number of communicative acts (messages) passed between agents. A high turn count for a seemingly simple task can indicate inefficiency, confusion, or a breakdown in coordination.20  
* **Reliability and Consistency Metrics:**  
  * **Consistency Score:** To measure the system's stability, each test case is run multiple times (e.g., N=5). The consistency score is the percentage of runs that produce an identical (or semantically equivalent, as judged by an LLM) final output. This metric, inspired by τ-bench's emphasis on reliability 12, is crucial for building user trust; a low score indicates a brittle and unpredictable system.  
  * **Database State Accuracy:** For tasks that require the agent to modify an external state (e.g., writing to a file, updating a database record), this metric from τ-bench 12 compares the final state of the external resource to the expected ground-truth state, providing a definitive measure of correct execution.

The evaluation of a complex system cannot be reduced to a single score. The metrics defined above exist in a web of interdependencies and trade-offs. For example, an attempt to minimize Latency might lead the orchestrator to generate a hasty, less thoughtful decomposition plan, resulting in a lower DQS. This, in turn, increases the likelihood of the specialist agent failing, ultimately reducing the overall Task Success Rate. Conversely, optimizing for a perfect DQS might require the orchestrator to perform more reasoning steps, thereby increasing both Cost and Latency. This multi-dimensional perspective is central to the CLASSic framework, which advocates for balancing Accuracy, Latency, and Cost.30

A truly expert-level evaluation must therefore move beyond reporting these metrics in isolation and instead analyze their relationships. An effective way to present these trade-offs in an academic report is through a Pareto frontier analysis. By plotting one metric against another—for instance, Task Success Rate vs. Total Cost—for different configurations of the agent system (e.g., using different LLMs for the agents), one can visualize the performance envelope. This analysis transforms the evaluation from a simple scoring exercise into a deep characterization of the system's operational behavior, a far more valuable contribution to the scientific understanding of these complex architectures.

The following table provides a comprehensive, single-point-of-reference for all quantitative metrics used in the HATT-E framework, ensuring clarity and facilitating reproducibility.

## **Section 3: Qualitative Evaluation, Communication Analysis, and Failure Modes**

While quantitative metrics provide the "what" of system performance, a deep understanding requires a qualitative analysis of the "why." This section details the methodologies for process-oriented evaluation, which involves examining the internal workings of the agent system to understand its reasoning, communication, and failure patterns. This approach is essential for generating the rich, explanatory insights expected in academic research and for guiding targeted improvements to the system.9

### **3.1. Process-Oriented Evaluation: Analyzing the "How"**

The core of qualitative evaluation is the systematic analysis of execution traces. Modern agent development frameworks, including the openai-agents-sdk 36, provide extensive logging and tracing capabilities. Observability platforms like PromptLayer 37, Arize 38, or Weights & Biases Weave 39 can be used to capture, store, and visualize these traces, which form the raw data for this analysis.

* **Trace Analysis:** This involves a manual or semi-automated review of the detailed logs generated during a task's execution. The key components to examine are:  
  * **Orchestrator's Reasoning Chain:** The internal "thoughts" or chain-of-thought reasoning of the Engineer Chat Agent must be scrutinized to understand how it interpreted the user's query and arrived at its final decomposition and delegation plan. This can reveal hidden biases or flaws in its reasoning logic.  
  * **Inter-Agent Communication Logs:** The content of the messages passed between the orchestrator and the specialists is a rich source of information. Analysis of these logs is critical for diagnosing "inter-agent misalignment," where the intended meaning of a message is lost or misinterpreted.34  
* **Communication Pattern Analysis:** By analyzing the sequence and frequency of messages between agents, it is possible to identify recurring communication patterns. These patterns can be classified to diagnose the health and efficiency of the collaboration.40 While the ideal pattern is a clean, hierarchical delegation, several pathological patterns can emerge:  
  * **Ideal Pattern (Hierarchical Delegation):** A simple, efficient flow: Orchestrator sends a task to Specialist 1; Orchestrator sends a task to Specialist 2; Specialist 1 returns a result to Orchestrator; Specialist 2 returns a result to Orchestrator.  
  * **Problematic Patterns:**  
    * *Ping-Ponging:* An excessive number of back-and-forth messages between the orchestrator and a single specialist for one sub-task. This often indicates that the initial instructions were unclear or that the specialist is stuck and repeatedly asking for help, signaling a failure in either decomposition (Layer 1\) or the specialist's capability (Layer 2).  
    * *Overloaded Agent:* A pattern where the orchestrator consistently delegates a disproportionate amount of work to one specialist. This suggests a flaw in the orchestrator's understanding of its team's capabilities or a bias in its delegation logic, leading to bottlenecks.40  
    * *Information Withholding / Hoarding:* A failure mode where a specialist agent successfully completes its sub-task but fails to communicate the result back to the orchestrator. This stalls the entire workflow and represents a critical communication breakdown.34

### **3.2. A Taxonomy of Multi-Agent Failures (Adapted from MAST)**

To bring structure and rigor to the qualitative analysis of errors, a formal failure taxonomy is indispensable. The Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy (MAST) provides an empirically grounded framework for classifying failures in MAS.34 This taxonomy is adapted here for the specific context of a hierarchical, tool-using system, providing a precise language for describing errors.

* Category 1: Specification Issues (Orchestrator Failures)  
  These failures originate from the top-level orchestrator agent and its core responsibilities of planning and delegation.  
  * **H-FM-1.1: Flawed Task Decomposition:** The orchestrator breaks the main task into sub-tasks that are illogical, incomplete, overlapping, or not aligned with the specialists' capabilities.  
  * **H-FM-1.2: Incorrect Delegation:** The orchestrator understands the sub-tasks correctly but assigns one or more to the wrong specialist agent.  
  * **H-FM-1.3: Disobeying Role Specification:** The orchestrator violates its defined role by attempting to execute a specialist task itself instead of delegating it.34  
* Category 2: Inter-Agent Misalignment (Handoff & Communication Failures)  
  These failures occur at the interface between agents and relate to the process of communication and information transfer.  
  * **H-FM-2.1: Context Loss on Handoff:** The orchestrator fails to pass a critical piece of information (e.g., a filename, a user-specified constraint) to the specialist during delegation, making the sub-task impossible to complete correctly.34  
  * **H-FM-2.2: Failure to Ask for Clarification:** A specialist receives an ambiguous or incomplete sub-task but proceeds with an assumption instead of querying the orchestrator for clarification, leading to an error.34  
  * **H-FM-2.3: Ignored Other Agent's Input:** The orchestrator receives a result (e.g., a failure report or a piece of data) from one specialist but fails to incorporate that information into its subsequent interactions with the other specialist.34  
  * **H-FM-2.4: Reasoning-Action Mismatch:** A specialist correctly reasons about the tool and parameters it should use but then proceeds to execute a different, incorrect action. This points to a disconnect between the agent's internal "thought" process and its action generation mechanism.34  
* Category 3: Task Verification & Integration Failures  
  These failures relate to the final stages of the workflow, including checking results and synthesizing the final answer.  
  * **H-FM-3.1: No or Incomplete Verification:** The orchestrator accepts a result from a specialist at face value without performing any sanity checks or verification, allowing an upstream error to propagate to the final output.34  
  * **H-FM-3.2: Premature Termination:** The system concludes its work and delivers a final answer to the user before all necessary sub-tasks have been successfully completed and their results integrated.34  
  * **H-FM-3.3: Faulty Result Synthesis:** The orchestrator receives correct and valid results from both specialists but fails to combine them into a single, logical, and coherent final answer that addresses the user's original query.

### **3.3. Ethical and Responsible AI Assessment**

A comprehensive evaluation must extend beyond functional correctness to include safety and responsibility, which are critical for real-world deployment.28

* **Bias Evaluation:** The evaluation dataset should include test cases designed to probe for harmful social biases (e.g., related to gender, race, or culture) in the system's outputs. For instance, a query for "a list of ten prominent software engineers" should be evaluated for the diversity of the generated list.  
* **Toxicity and Harmful Content:** All final outputs generated by the system during testing should be passed through a safety filter, such as the OpenAI Moderation API 36 or a similar tool. The rate of outputs flagged for toxicity, hate speech, or other harmful categories should be recorded and reported.  
* **Privacy Violations:** The test dataset must include prompts containing mock Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. The evaluation must verify that the agent system does not leak this PII in its final output or in its internal communication logs, which could be a significant security risk.35

The patterns of failure observed during qualitative analysis are more than just a list of errors; they serve as a powerful diagnostic signal pointing to deeper architectural flaws. A high frequency of failures in the "Specification Issues" category (e.g., H-FM-1.1, Flawed Task Decomposition) strongly suggests that the core problem lies within the orchestrator agent's prompting or reasoning logic. Engineering efforts should, therefore, be focused on improving this Layer 1 component. In contrast, a high frequency of "Inter-Agent Misalignment" failures (e.g., H-FM-2.1, Context Loss on Handoff) indicates that the problem is not with the agents themselves but with the communication protocol and state management system that connects them. By mapping the observed failure modes from the taxonomy back to the functional layers of the HATT-E framework, it is possible to construct a "diagnostic matrix." This matrix provides a targeted, data-driven guide for debugging and iterative improvement. This approach transforms the evaluation process from a simple "report card" into an actionable engineering tool, representing a significant methodological advance for the study of multi-agent systems.

The following table provides a structured reference for classifying observed errors, using examples tailored to the user's ai-ran-sim application context.

**Table 3: Multi-Agent Failure Taxonomy with Examples for ai-ran-sim**

| Failure Mode ID | Failure Mode Name | HATT-E Layer of Origin | Description | Hypothetical Example |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **H-FM-1.1** | Flawed Task Decomposition | 1 | Orchestrator creates illogical or incomplete sub-tasks. | User asks to "fix the bug in main.py and optimize its performance." The orchestrator only creates a sub-task for "fix the bug," ignoring the optimization part. |
| **H-FM-1.2** | Incorrect Delegation | 1 | Orchestrator assigns a sub-task to the wrong specialist. | Orchestrator delegates a "database query" sub-task to the agent whose only tool is for "file system analysis." |
| **H-FM-2.1** | Context Loss on Handoff | 1 \-\> 2 | Orchestrator fails to pass critical information to a specialist. | Orchestrator tells the file analysis agent to "read the log file" but fails to pass the filename error.log specified by the user. |
| **H-FM-2.2** | Fail to ask for Clarification | 2 | Specialist proceeds with an ambiguous task instead of asking for help. | Orchestrator says "analyze the file." The specialist, without knowing which file, defaults to app.log instead of asking "Which file should I analyze?" |
| **H-FM-2.4** | Reasoning-Action Mismatch | 2 | Specialist reasons correctly but executes an incorrect action. | Specialist's thought process is "I need to read the file data.csv." The actual tool call executed is read\_file('config.json'). |
| **H-FM-3.1** | No or Incomplete Verification | 1 or 3 | Orchestrator accepts a specialist's result without checking it. | The code-fixing specialist reports "bug fixed," but the orchestrator doesn't run a test to verify, passing the broken code to the user. |
| **H-FM-3.3** | Faulty Result Synthesis | 1 or 3 | Orchestrator fails to combine correct results from specialists. | One specialist reports "Database latency is 500ms." The other reports "CPU usage is at 90%." The orchestrator's final answer is "The system is slow," failing to synthesize the specific details. |

## **Section 4: Practical Implementation and Tooling**

This section provides a pragmatic, step-by-step guide to implementing the HATT-E framework. A rigorous evaluation is not merely a theoretical construct; it requires a well-designed dataset, a robust technical pipeline, and the strategic use of automation to ensure that the process is both scalable and repeatable.

### **4.1. Designing a Bespoke Evaluation Dataset**

The quality and relevance of the evaluation dataset are paramount to the validity of the results.43 Generic benchmarks are insufficient for testing the specific capabilities of a hierarchical agent. Therefore, the creation of a bespoke dataset tailored to the system's intended functions is a critical first step.

* **Methodology for Dataset Creation:**  
  1. **Define Core Capabilities:** Begin by enumerating the specific, high-level tasks the multi-agent system is designed to accomplish. For the ai-ran-sim application, these might include capabilities like "Given a bug report, analyze the relevant log file and propose a code fix" or "Query network performance statistics from a database and generate a summary report."  
  2. **Create "Golden" Trajectories:** For each core capability, manually author a complete, ideal interaction trace. This ground truth artifact is more than just a final answer; it must specify the ideal user prompt, the optimal decomposition of the task by the orchestrator, the precise tool calls (including agent and parameters) for each specialist, and the perfectly synthesized final response.43 This detailed trajectory serves as the gold standard against which the system's performance is measured.  
  3. **Generate Variations using an LLM:** To create a dataset of sufficient size and diversity, use a powerful generator LLM (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to create variations of the golden trajectories.43 This process should include:  
     * *Paraphrasing:* Generating multiple rephrasings of the user prompt to test the orchestrator's robustness to linguistic variation.  
     * *Adding Complexity:* Introducing additional constraints, secondary objectives, or multi-step dependencies into the prompt.  
     * *Introducing Ambiguity:* Crafting prompts that are intentionally underspecified, forcing the orchestrator to make a non-trivial decision or ask a clarifying question.  
  4. **Develop Test Case Categories:** A robust dataset should be stratified to test different aspects of the agent's behavior.43 A recommended distribution is:  
     * **Happy Path (40% of dataset):** Straightforward requests where the ideal workflow is unambiguous. These test the system's baseline competence.  
     * **Edge Cases (40% of dataset):** These test the system's limits. Examples include highly complex, multi-step requests; prompts with missing information that require clarification; and tasks that necessitate a sequential dependency between the two specialist agents (e.g., the output of Specialist 1 is required as input for Specialist 2).  
     * **Adversarial/Failure Cases (20% of dataset):** These are designed to intentionally induce failures to test the system's robustness and error handling. This includes prompts that are deceptive (e.g., appearing to require one specialist but actually needing the other), prompts with invalid inputs (e.g., a non-existent filename), and prompts designed to test safety guardrails.

### **4.2. The Evaluation Pipeline: From Execution to Analysis**

This subsection outlines the end-to-end technical workflow for executing an evaluation run.

* **Step 1: Instrumentation and Logging:** The first step is to ensure that every aspect of the agent's operation is logged. Frameworks like the openai-agents-sdk 36 and LangGraph 1 offer built-in tracing capabilities. This instrumentation must capture every agent's internal thoughts, all actions (including tool calls with their parameters and outputs), and all inter-agent communications. These detailed traces should be stored in a structured format (e.g., JSONL) and can be managed using specialized platforms like PromptLayer 37 or W\&B Weave.39  
* **Step 2: Batch Execution:** A master script should be developed to automate the execution of the evaluation. This script will iterate through every test case in the evaluation dataset, pass the prompt to the multi-agent application, and save the complete, unabridged execution trace for that run to a results directory.  
* **Step 3: Automated Scoring (Quantitative Metrics):** Following the batch execution, a second script—the scoring script—processes the saved traces. It parses each trace to extract the necessary information and calculate the quantitative metrics defined in Section 2\. For example, it will find all tool calls in the trace, compare them against the golden trajectory for that test case, and compute the Act.EM score.  
* **Step 4: LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation (Qualitative Metrics):** For metrics that require qualitative assessment (like DQS), the scoring script will extract the relevant portion of the trace (e.g., the orchestrator's decomposition plan) and submit it to a judge LLM via an API call. The prompt to the judge will contain the specific rubric for that metric. The judge's structured output (e.g., a JSON with scores) is then parsed and saved.  
* **Step 5: Results Aggregation and Visualization:** The final script in the pipeline aggregates all the quantitative and qualitative scores from all test runs. It computes summary statistics such as means, medians, and standard deviations for each metric. This script should also generate the key visualizations for the academic report, such as the tables and the Pareto frontier plots that illustrate performance trade-offs.

### **4.3. Leveraging LLM-as-a-Judge for Qualitative Metrics**

The use of an LLM to automate qualitative assessment is a powerful technique that makes rigorous evaluation scalable.27 However, the reliability of the judge itself must be ensured through careful implementation.

* **Best Practices for LLM-as-a-Judge:**  
  * **Use a Capable Judge:** The judging LLM should be the most powerful and well-reasoned model available (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet 30), as it is being asked to perform a complex, nuanced evaluation task.  
  * **Provide Clear and Structured Rubrics:** The prompt sent to the judge is critical. It must contain an unambiguous definition of the metric being evaluated, the scoring scale to be used, and clear, descriptive anchors for each point on the scale.20  
  * **Require Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:** The judge should be instructed to first provide a step-by-step rationale for its score before giving the final score itself. This makes the evaluation process transparent, allows for manual auditing of the judge's reasoning, and helps in debugging cases where the judge might be making errors.  
  * **Use Few-Shot Examples:** The prompt should include two to three illustrative examples of both "good" and "bad" cases. This helps to calibrate the judge and align its scoring with the desired standards.  
* **Example Rubric Prompt for Decomposition Quality Score (DQS):**  
  You are an expert AI system evaluator. Your task is to assess the quality of a task decomposition plan created by an orchestrator agent based on a user request.

  \*\*User Request:\*\*  
  {user\_request}

  \*\*Orchestrator's Decomposition Plan:\*\*  
  \- Sub-task 1 (for Specialist A): {sub\_task\_1}  
  \- Sub-task 2 (for Specialist B): {sub\_task\_2}

  \*\*Evaluation Criteria & Rubric:\*\*  
  1\.  \*\*Logical Coherence (Scale 1-5):\*\* How logical is the breakdown of the main goal?  
      \- 1: Illogical or nonsensical decomposition.  
      \- 3: A plausible but suboptimal or partially illogical breakdown.  
      \- 5: A perfectly logical and coherent decomposition.  
  2\.  \*\*Completeness (Scale 1-5):\*\* Do the sub-tasks fully address all aspects of the user's request?  
      \- 1: Completely misses key parts of the request.  
      \- 3: Addresses the main part of the request but misses minor details or constraints.  
      \- 5: Fully covers all explicit and implicit parts of the request.  
  3\.  \*\*Efficiency (Scale 1-5):\*\* Is the breakdown efficient, or does it contain redundant steps?  
      \- 1: Highly inefficient with significant redundancy.  
      \- 3: Contains minor inefficiencies or one redundant step.  
      \- 5: Optimally efficient with no redundant steps.

  \*\*Instructions:\*\*  
  First, provide a step-by-step analysis of the decomposition plan against each of the three criteria, explaining your reasoning for the scores.  
  Second, provide a numerical score for each criterion.  
  Finally, output the scores in a single JSON object: {"coherence": \<score\>, "completeness": \<score\>, "efficiency": \<score\>}.

The evaluation pipeline should not be viewed as a one-time, post-development activity. Instead, it forms the core of an iterative development loop, analogous to the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines in traditional software engineering. Platforms like PromptLayer 37 and Arize 38 are built on this principle of iterative improvement: test, evaluate, identify failures and edge cases, and then refine the system's prompts, logic, or architecture. The detailed output from the HATT-E pipeline—a rich set of quantitative scores and a categorized list of qualitative failures—provides the direct, actionable feedback needed for the next development cycle. If the average DQS score is low, the developer knows to focus on improving the orchestrator's planning prompt. If the TSR for a specific specialist is low, the developer knows to improve that agent's tool-use error handling. This transforms evaluation from a "final exam" into a "continuous feedback mechanism," dramatically accelerating the process of developing a robust, reliable, and production-ready multi-agent system. This perspective on the role of evaluation is a key element of a mature approach to AI engineering.

## **Section 5: Synthesis and Recommendations for Academic Reporting**

This final section provides guidance on how to structure the findings from the HATT-E evaluation into a clear, compelling, and high-impact narrative for an academic research report. The objective is to present the results in a manner that not only demonstrates the performance of the agent system but also highlights the novelty of its architecture and the rigor of the evaluation methodology itself.

### **5.1. Structuring the "Results" Section of Your Paper**

The organization of the results section should guide the reader from a high-level understanding of the system's performance down to the detailed, diagnostic insights that explain that performance.

* **Start with System-Level Performance (Layer 3):** Begin the section by presenting the top-line, end-to-end metrics. This includes the Overall Task Success Rate (SR), average Cost, and average Latency. This information provides the reader with the ultimate "bottom line" and allows for a direct, high-level comparison against any baseline models you have evaluated.  
* **Drill Down into Component Performance (Layers 1 & 2):** After establishing the overall performance, use the layered metrics from the HATT-E framework to build an explanatory narrative. This is where the diagnostic power of the framework is demonstrated.  
  * Present the Layer 1 Orchestration metrics (DQS, DA, HIF). High scores in this area would support a claim that the hierarchical planning component of the architecture is effective.  
  * Present the Layer 2 Specialist metrics (Act.EM, TSR). High scores here would demonstrate the proficiency of the individual sub-agents in executing their delegated tasks.  
* **Showcase the Performance Trade-offs:** A sophisticated analysis goes beyond reporting individual metrics and explores their relationships. Include the Pareto frontier analysis, for example, by plotting Task Success Rate against Total Cost for different system configurations. This visualization provides a nuanced view of the system's operational characteristics and demonstrates a deep understanding of the inherent trade-offs in complex AI systems.

### **5.2. Presenting the Qualitative Analysis**

Qualitative findings should be woven into the narrative to provide context and explanation for the quantitative data.

* **Integrate Qualitative Findings with Quantitative Data:** Avoid creating a separate, disconnected section for qualitative results. Instead, use them to explain the quantitative scores. For example, a compelling statement would be: "The system achieved an Overall Task Success Rate of 72%. A qualitative analysis of the 28% of failed runs, categorized using our H-MAST taxonomy (Table 3), revealed that the dominant failure mode was Flawed Task Decomposition (H-FM-1.1), which accounted for 65% of all failures. This indicates that the primary performance bottleneck resides in the orchestrator agent's planning capabilities."  
* **Include Illustrative Case Studies:** To make the abstract concepts of agent interaction concrete, select two or three powerful examples from the evaluation. Walk the reader through the complete multi-agent trace for a clear success, an interesting and informative failure, and a challenging edge case. Display snippets of the inter-agent communication logs and annotate them to show how the agents collaborated (or failed to), explicitly referencing the failure modes from your taxonomy. This brings the system's behavior to life for the reader.

### **5.3. The "Discussion" and "Future Work" Sections**

This is the part of the paper where the broader implications of the work are discussed and the path forward is outlined.

* **Discuss the Implications of the HATT-E Framework:** Argue that the maturation of multi-agent systems research requires a move away from simple, monolithic evaluations. Propose that layered, diagnostic frameworks like HATT-E are necessary to understand the complex internal dynamics of these systems and to enable principled, targeted improvements.  
* **Acknowledge Limitations:** A strong academic paper transparently acknowledges the limitations of its methodology. Discuss the potential for bias or error in the LLM-as-a-Judge approach. Acknowledge that the bespoke evaluation dataset, while tailored to the system, may not cover all possible scenarios and could have its own inherent biases.  
* **Propose Future Work:** Based on the findings and limitations, suggest concrete avenues for future research. This could include:  
  * Developing more sophisticated and automated metrics for communication efficiency and collaborative quality.  
  * Creating standardized, open-source benchmarks specifically designed for evaluating hierarchical agent architectures.  
  * Exploring agent architectures that incorporate self-correction mechanisms, where agents can use evaluation feedback in real-time to learn from their mistakes and improve their performance autonomously.9

### **5.4. Final Checklist for a High-Impact Academic Report**

Before submission, perform a final review against the following criteria to ensure the report meets the standards of a top-tier academic publication:

* **Clear Contribution:** Does the abstract and introduction clearly articulate that the paper's primary contributions are twofold: (1) the novel hierarchical multi-agent architecture, and (2) the rigorous, bespoke HATT-E evaluation framework designed to assess it?  
* **Reproducibility:** Is the methodology presented with sufficient detail to allow another research group to replicate the study? Are all metrics precisely defined (as in Table 2)? Is the dataset creation process clearly explained? Is the evaluation pipeline described in full?  
* **Robust Comparison:** Has the system been compared against relevant and challenging baselines? This could include a "flat" (non-hierarchical) multi-agent system that uses the same specialists, or a single, monolithic agent that has access to all tools.  
* **Insightful Analysis:** Does the report move beyond simply presenting tables of numbers? Does it provide deep, well-supported insights into *why* the system behaves the way it does, leveraging the full diagnostic power of the HATT-E framework to connect outcomes to root causes?

By adhering to this structure and these principles, the resulting academic report will not only effectively present the performance of the developed AI application but will also make a significant and lasting methodological contribution to the broader field of AI agent evaluation.
